;;; Commentary:

;; A multiview for displaying open buffers and files accociated with a project.
;; When no project is open in the current buffer display a list of known project.
;; and select a file from the selected project.
;;
;; Just run the function `consult-project' and/or bind it to a hotkey.
;;
;; To filter the multiview use:
;; B - For project related buffers
;; F - For project related files
;; P - For known projects
