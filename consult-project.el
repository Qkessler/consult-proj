;;; Commentary:

;; Creates an endpoint for accessing different project sources. The consult view
;; can be narrowed to: (b) current project's buffers, (f) current project's files
;; and (p) to select from the list of known projects.

;; The buffer and project file sources are only enabled in case that the user is
;; in a project file/buffer. See `project-current'.

;; A different action is issued depending on the source. For both buffers and
;; project files, the default action is to visit the selected element. When a
;; known project is selected, a list to select from is created with the selected
;; project's files.
